# Prompt: Accessibility, Audio, and Motion Specs

You are an accessibility and UX engineer. Provide specs that ensure the console-like UI remains accessible and performant.

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation map; focus order; skip links.
- Color contrast targets (WCAG AA); alternative states for color-blind users.
- ARIA roles/labels for interactive components.

## Audio
- Volume levels; default on/off; global mute; respect OS reduced motion/audio settings.

## Motion
- Use GPU-accelerated transforms; duration/easing guidelines; p95 FPS targets.

## Output
- Checklist and test cases to verify compliance.
